Watershed Segmentation Algorithm
===================

Watershed segmentation algorithm to separate different areas in a given image

This code implements OpenCV based watershed segmentation algorithm. It's a pretty famous algorithm. I have included sample input images along with this project. There is a file called "CMakeLists.txt". This file will be used to build the project (if you have built OpenCV using cmake). If not, just use the .cpp file in your project and build it. To build using command line, follow the steps below to get it up and running:

	$ cmake .
	$ make
	$ ./main image1.jpg

The output will be displayed on a window and you can see the instructions on the terminal.
